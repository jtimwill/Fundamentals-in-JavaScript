An electric current is a flow of electric charge.[1]:2 In electric circuits this
charge is often carried by moving electrons in a wire. It can also be carried by
ions in an electrolyte, or by both ions and electrons such as in an ionised gas
(plasma).[2]

The SI unit for measuring an electric current is the ampere, which is the flow
of electric charge across a surface at the rate of one coulomb per second.
Electric current is measured using a device called an ammeter.[3]

Electric currents cause Joule heating, which creates light in incandescent light
bulbs. They also create magnetic fields, which are used in motors, inductors and
generators.

The moving charged particles in an electric current are called charge carriers.
In metals, one or more electrons from each atom are loosely bound to the atom,
and can move freely about within the metal. These conduction electrons are the
charge carriers in metal conductors.

Voltage is the difference in electric potential between two points. The
difference in electric potential between two points (i.e., voltage) in a static
electric field is defined as the work needed per unit of charge to move a test
charge between the two points. In the International System of Units, the derived
unit for voltage is named volt.[1] In SI units, work per unit charge is
expressed as joules per coulomb, where 1 volt = 1 joule (of work) per 1 coulomb
(of charge). The official SI definition for volt uses power and current, where 1
volt = 1 watt (of power) per 1 ampere (of current).[1] This definition is
equivalent to the more commonly used 'joules per coulomb'. Voltage or electric
potential difference is denoted symbolically by ∆V, but more often simply as V,
for instance in the context of Ohm's or Kirchhoff's circuit laws.

Electric potential differences between points can be caused by electric charge,
by electric current through a magnetic field, by time-varying magnetic fields,
or some combination of these three.[2][3] A voltmeter can be used to measure the
voltage (or potential difference) between two points in a system; often a common
reference potential such as the ground of the system is used as one of the
points. A voltage may represent either a source of energy (electromotive force)
or lost, used, or stored energy (potential drop).

An electric motor is an electrical machine that converts electrical energy into
mechanical energy. Most electric motors operate through the interaction between
the motor's magnetic field and winding currents to generate force in the form of
rotation. Electric motors can be powered by direct current (DC) sources, such as
from batteries, motor vehicles or rectifiers, or by alternating current (AC)
sources, such as a power grid, inverters or electrical generators. An electric
generator is mechanically identical to an electric motor, but operates in the
reverse direction, accepting mechanical energy (such as from flowing water) and
converting this mechanical energy into electrical energy.

Electric motors may be classified by considerations such as power source type,
internal construction, application and type of motion output. In addition to AC
versus DC types, motors may be brushed or brushless, may be of various phase
(see single-phase, two-phase, or three-phase), and may be either air-cooled or
liquid-cooled. General-purpose motors with standard dimensions and
characteristics provide convenient mechanical power for industrial use. The
largest electric motors are used for ship propulsion, pipeline compression and
pumped-storage applications with ratings reaching 100 megawatts. Electric motors
are found in industrial fans, blowers and pumps, machine tools, household
appliances, power tools and disk drives. Small motors may be found in electric
watches.

In certain applications, such as in regenerative braking with traction motors,
electric motors can be used in reverse as generators to recover energy that
might otherwise be lost as heat and friction.

Electric motors produce linear or rotary force (torque) and can be distinguished
from devices such as magnetic solenoids and loudspeakers that convert
electricity into motion but do not generate usable mechanical force, which are
respectively referred to as actuators and transducers.

A transistor is a semiconductor device used to amplify or switch electronic
signals and electrical power. It is composed of semiconductor material usually
with at least three terminals for connection to an external circuit. A voltage
or current applied to one pair of the transistor's terminals controls the
current through another pair of terminals. Because the controlled (output) power
can be higher than the controlling (input) power, a transistor can amplify a
signal. Today, some transistors are packaged individually, but many more are
found embedded in integrated circuits.

The transistor is the fundamental building block of modern electronic devices,
and is ubiquitous in modern electronic systems. Julius Edgar Lilienfeld patented
a field-effect transistor in 1926[1] but it was not possible to actually
construct a working device at that time. The first practically implemented
device was a point-contact transistor invented in 1947 by American physicists
John Bardeen, Walter Brattain, and William Shockley. The transistor
revolutionized the field of electronics, and paved the way for smaller and
cheaper radios, calculators, and computers, among other things. The transistor
is on the list of IEEE milestones in electronics,[2] and Bardeen, Brattain, and
Shockley shared the 1956 Nobel Prize in Physics for their achievement.[3]

Most transistors are made from very pure silicon or germanium, but certain other
semiconductor materials can also be used. A transistor may have only one kind of
charge carrier, in a field effect transistor, or may have two kinds of charge
carriers in bipolar junction transistor devices. Compared with the vacuum tube,
transistors are generally smaller, and require less power to operate. Certain
vacuum tubes have advantages over transistors at very high operating frequencies
or high operating voltages. Many types of transistors are made to standardized
specifications by multiple manufacturers.

* Simplified operation *

The essential usefulness of a transistor comes from its ability to use a small
signal applied between one pair of its terminals to control a much larger signal
at another pair of terminals. This property is called gain. It can produce a
stronger output signal, a voltage or current, which is proportional to a weaker
input signal; that is, it can act as an amplifier. Alternatively, the transistor
can be used to turn current on or off in a circuit as an electrically controlled
switch, where the amount of current is determined by other circuit elements.

There are two types of transistors, which have slight differences in how they
are used in a circuit. A bipolar transistor has terminals labeled base,
collector, and emitter. A small current at the base terminal (that is, flowing
between the base and the emitter) can control or switch a much larger current
between the collector and emitter terminals. For a field-effect transistor, the
terminals are labeled gate, source, and drain, and a voltage at the gate can
control a current between source and drain.

A transformer is a static electrical device that transfers electrical energy
between two or more circuits. A varying current in one coil of the transformer
produces a varying magnetic flux, which, in turn, induces a varying
electromotive force across a second coil wound around the same core. Electrical
energy can be transferred between the two coils, without a metallic connection
between the two circuits. Faraday's law of induction discovered in 1831
described the induced voltage effect in any coil due to changing magnetic flux
encircled by the coil.

Transformers are used for increasing or decreasing the alternating voltages in
electric power applications, and for coupling the stages of signal processing
circuits.

Since the invention of the first constant-potential transformer in 1885,
transformers have become essential for the transmission, distribution, and
utilization of alternating current electric power.[3] A wide range of
transformer designs is encountered in electronic and electric power
applications. Transformers range in size from RF transformers less than a cubic
centimeter in volume, to units weighing hundreds of tons used to interconnect
the power grid.

In the broadest definition, a sensor is a device, module, or subsystem whose
purpose is to detect events or changes in its environment and send the
information to other electronics, frequently a computer processor. A sensor is
always used with other electronics.

Sensors are used in everyday objects such as touch-sensitive elevator buttons
(tactile sensor) and lamps which dim or brighten by touching the base, besides
innumerable applications of which most people are never aware. With advances in
micromachinery and easy-to-use microcontroller platforms, the uses of sensors
have expanded beyond the traditional fields of temperature, pressure or flow
measurement,[1] for example into MARG sensors. Moreover, analog sensors such as
potentiometers and force-sensing resistors are still widely used. Applications
include manufacturing and machinery, airplanes and aerospace, cars, medicine,
robotics and many other aspects of our day-to-day life.

A sensor's sensitivity indicates how much the sensor's output changes when the
input quantity being measured changes. For instance, if the mercury in a
thermometer moves 1  cm when the temperature changes by 1 °C, the sensitivity is
1 cm/°C (it is basically the slope Dy/Dx assuming a linear characteristic). Some
sensors can also affect what they measure; for instance, a room temperature
thermometer inserted into a hot cup of liquid cools the liquid while the liquid
heats the thermometer. Sensors are usually designed to have a small effect on
what is measured; making the sensor smaller often improves this and may
introduce other advantages.[2] Technological progress allows more and more
sensors to be manufactured on a microscopic scale as microsensors using MEMS
technology. In most cases, a microsensor reaches a significantly higher speed
and sensitivity compared with macroscopic approaches.[3][4]
